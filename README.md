# TesserCrypt
 A Tesseract geometry based file encryption solution.

## Background

## Basic Theory
The Basic concept is to use matrix transforms to manipulate a Tesseract coordinate matrix.  Initially only single axis rotation and uniform scale transformations will be used. 

The end goal is to be able to scale arbitrarily, perform multi-axis rotation and inverting transformations.
 
 
## 4D spacial coordinates
The mathematical convention is to use W for the 4th dimensional axis.
